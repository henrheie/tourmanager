TourManager Scraper
===================

The ``scraper.py`` module provides utilities for importing rider
rankings from [letour.fr](https://www.letour.fr/en/rankings).  Use the
``scrape_all_riders_with_cost`` function to populate the database with
riders and automatically assign a cost value based on their position in
the general classification.  Network access is required to run the
scraper.

Running the scraper
-------------------
1. Make sure the Flask application and database are configured.
2. Execute ``python run_scraper.py`` from the repository root. The script
   creates the application context and downloads the rider rankings,
   updating the ``Rider`` table with calculated costs.
